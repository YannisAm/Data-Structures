# The journey to Data-Structures

##### This project is beeing made for better understanding of data structures. For this reason not only we can understand what their purpose is but also we will write them again in C#. Below follows a list from all the data structures that are currently finished.

1. Stack



### STACK

Stack is one of the most important of them. With this data structure starts the new programmer to learn about the data structures and how it will upgrade his/her programming abilities.

Let's visualize how a stack is:

  As we can see in the picture there is only one way to push or pop items in and out of the stack respectively. The last element that enters the stack, it is the first element that exits it. This procedure is called LIFO (Last In First Out). If we put three elements in the stack and we want to remove the bottom down element then **we have to remove** all the elements above it. Please check the Stack project for further knowledge.
