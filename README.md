# The journey to Data-Structures

##### This project is beeing made for the better understanding of data structures. For this reason not only I can understand what their purpose is but also I will code them in C#. Below follows a list from all the data structures that are currently finished.

1. Stack



### STACK

Stack is one of the most important of them. With this data structure starts the new programmer to learn about the data structures and how it will upgrade his/her programming abilities.

Let's visualize how a stack is:

  As we can see in the picture there is only one way to push or pop items in and out of the stack respectively. The last element that enters the stack, it is the first element that exits it. This procedure is called LIFO (Last In First Out). If we put three elements in the stack and we want to remove the bottom down element then **we have to remove** all the elements above it. Please check the Stack project for further knowledge.


### QUEUE

#### 1. Simple Queue

I am going to code two different kinds of queues. Let's start with the simple one.

  *  In the simple queue the first element that enters, is the first element that exits. This procedure is called FIFO
(First In First Out). When we put an element we call it **enqueue** and we take an element out we call it **dequeue** So, when we extract the first element, then all the other elements must occupy the position in front of them. This procedure uses a lot of resources, especially if we have a queue with many elements. Later we are going to see how to make the queue more efficient.

Let's visualize the simple queue:
